# arm-class
This repo contains projects I have developed for the 
**Embedded Systems Essentials with Arm: Getting Started** course (ArmEducation ESE101). 
These programs are written in C++, intended to compile and run on the MBED Simulator 
under Docker.

To try them out:
1. Install Docker
2. Pull the simulator into Docker:  `docker pull armedu/mbed_sim`
3. Run the simulator:  `docker run -p 7829:7829 armedu/mbed_sim`
4. Connect to the simulator in Firefox or Chrome: http://localhost:7829/
5. Copy the code and paste it into the left side of the simulator
6. Using the pin list near the top of the file, add appropriate components to the simulated circuit on the right.
7. Click the Run button. Try out the inputs and watch the LEDs :)
